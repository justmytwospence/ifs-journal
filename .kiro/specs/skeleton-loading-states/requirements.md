# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces traditional spinner-based loading indicators with skeleton screens across the IFS Journal application. Skeleton screens provide a better user experience by showing the structure of content while it loads, reducing perceived loading time and preventing layout shifts. The implementation will leverage React Query's loading states to manage data fetching and display appropriate skeleton UI components.

## Glossary

- **Skeleton Screen**: A UI pattern that displays placeholder content in the shape and position of actual content while data is loading
- **React Query**: A data fetching and state management library that provides built-in loading, error, and success states
- **Loading State**: The period between initiating a data fetch and receiving the response
- **Layout Shift**: Visual instability that occurs when content suddenly appears or moves on the page
- **Spinner**: A rotating circular animation traditionally used to indicate loading (to be replaced)
- **Application**: The IFS Journal web application
- **User**: A person using the IFS Journal application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a User, I want to see skeleton placeholders instead of spinners when pages are loading, so that I can better understand what content is coming and experience less visual disruption

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User navigates to the Parts page, THE Application SHALL display skeleton cards in a grid layout matching the final parts layout
2. WHEN the User navigates to the Journal Log page, THE Application SHALL display skeleton entry cards matching the final entry card layout
3. WHEN the User navigates to a Part Detail page, THE Application SHALL display skeleton placeholders for the part header, quotes section, and conversation area
4. THE Application SHALL NOT display any spinner animations on page load
5. WHEN content finishes loading, THE Application SHALL replace skeleton placeholders with actual content without layout shift

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a User, I want skeleton screens to accurately represent the structure of the content being loaded, so that I can anticipate what information will appear

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL display skeleton placeholders that match the dimensions and positioning of actual content elements
2. THE Application SHALL display skeleton placeholders with appropriate spacing and gaps matching the final layout
3. THE Application SHALL display skeleton text lines with varying widths to simulate natural text patterns
4. THE Application SHALL display skeleton elements with rounded corners matching the design system
5. THE Application SHALL animate skeleton placeholders with a subtle shimmer effect to indicate loading

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a User, I want React Query to manage loading states efficiently, so that I experience consistent and predictable loading behavior across the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL use React Query hooks for all data fetching operations that currently display loading states
2. WHEN React Query indicates a loading state, THE Application SHALL display skeleton screens
3. WHEN React Query indicates a success state, THE Application SHALL display actual content
4. WHEN React Query indicates an error state, THE Application SHALL display error messages without skeleton placeholders
5. THE Application SHALL cache fetched data according to React Query configuration to minimize unnecessary loading states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a User, I want skeleton screens to appear immediately when I navigate to a page, so that I perceive the application as fast and responsive

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL display skeleton screens within 16 milliseconds of page navigation
2. THE Application SHALL NOT display a blank white screen before showing skeleton placeholders
3. WHEN the User navigates between pages, THE Application SHALL immediately show skeleton screens for the new page
4. THE Application SHALL maintain skeleton screens until actual data is available for rendering
5. THE Application SHALL display skeleton screens for a minimum of 200 milliseconds to prevent flashing on fast connections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want reusable skeleton components, so that I can easily implement consistent loading states throughout the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL provide a SkeletonCard component for card-based layouts
2. THE Application SHALL provide a SkeletonText component for text content placeholders
3. THE Application SHALL provide a SkeletonCircle component for avatar and icon placeholders
4. THE Application SHALL provide a SkeletonRectangle component for generic rectangular placeholders
5. THE Application SHALL allow skeleton components to accept size and styling props for customization
