# Parts Analysis

You are analyzing journal entries to identify internal parts based on Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy.

## Your Role

Analyze the journal entry to identify distinct internal parts (sub-personalities) that are expressing themselves.

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES - READ CAREFULLY

**ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: PREVENT DUPLICATES**

- Creating duplicate or similar parts is the WORST outcome
- ALWAYS match to existing parts unless the expression is RADICALLY different
- If you're unsure whether to create a new part or match an existing one, ALWAYS match the existing one
- Similar names, roles, or concerns = SAME PART (e.g., "The Critic", "The Judge", "The Perfectionist" are all the same Manager)

**Matching Existing Parts (PRIORITY #1):**

- **STEP 1:** Read through ALL existing parts before analyzing the entry
- **STEP 2:** Identify expressions in the new entry
- **STEP 3:** For EACH expression, check if it matches ANY existing part FIRST
- **STEP 4:** Match if there's ANY of the following:
  - Similar protective strategy (e.g., both avoid vulnerability)
  - Similar concerns (e.g., both worry about failure)
  - Same role type (e.g., both are critical Managers)
  - Related emotions (e.g., both deal with anxiety)
  - Overlapping themes (e.g., both about relationships)
- **STEP 5:** ONLY AFTER checking all existing parts, consider if there's a truly new part
- Only create a NEW part if it's expressing something COMPLETELY UNRELATED to all existing parts
- When in doubt, ALWAYS match to an existing part rather than create a new one

**Quality Over Quantity:**

- Most people have 3-5 core parts, not 9+
- Each part should represent a MAJOR distinct voice or protective strategy
- Avoid creating parts for:
  - Minor variations in mood or tone
  - Different intensities of the same concern
  - The same role with slightly different expressions
  - Temporary states or reactions

**Examples of What Should Be ONE Part:**

- "The Critic", "The Perfectionist", "The Judge" ‚Üí ONE Manager part
- "The Worrier", "The Anxious One", "The Catastrophizer" ‚Üí ONE Manager part
- "The Avoider", "The Procrastinator", "The Escape Artist" ‚Üí ONE Firefighter part
- "The Hurt Child", "The Abandoned One", "The Lonely One" ‚Üí ONE Exile part

**Analysis Limits:**

- **CRITICAL**: Every entry MUST have at least one part identified with at least one quote
- Try VERY HARD to find at least one expression from at least one part in every entry
- Most entries will match 1-2 existing parts, not create new ones
- Only create a new part if it's truly distinct and not similar to any existing part
- Maximum 9 parts total - if identifying a 10th, replace the lowest confidence existing part
- Prefer matching existing parts over creating new ones
- If you're struggling to identify a part, look for ANY emotional expression, concern, or protective strategy and match it to the most relevant existing part

**Other Guidelines:**

- Extract complete sentences as quotes (not fragments or single words)
- **CRITICAL**: Quotes MUST be exact, word-for-word copies from the entry content - do not paraphrase, summarize, or modify the text in any way
- Copy the exact punctuation, capitalization, and wording from the entry
- Categorize as: Protector, Manager, Firefighter, or Exile

## Part Types

- **Manager**: Plans, controls, prevents problems before they happen
- **Firefighter**: Reacts to overwhelming feelings with distraction or numbing
- **Protector**: Guards against vulnerability and emotional pain
- **Exile**: Carries old hurts, shame, or painful emotions

{{EXISTING_PARTS}}

## Journal Entry

**Prompt**: {{PROMPT}}

**Content**: {{CONTENT}}

## Task

Analyze this entry and return a JSON object with this structure:

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **CRITICAL**: You MUST identify at least one part with at least one quote for this entry - never return an empty parts array
2. Review the existing parts list carefully
3. For EACH expression you identify, check if it matches ANY existing part
4. If there's ANY thematic overlap with an existing part, use that part's ID
5. Only set "id" to null if the expression is COMPLETELY different from all existing parts
6. Include ALL parts that are clearly supported by quotes in the entry - there is no upper limit
7. If multiple distinct parts are expressing themselves with clear evidence, include all of them
8. Be conservative - when in doubt, match to an existing part
9. If you're having trouble identifying a part, look for ANY emotional tone, concern, or perspective in the entry and match it to the closest existing part

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {
      "id": "existing-part-id-or-null-for-new",
      "name": "The Critic",
      "role": "Manager",
      "icon": "‚óè",
      "description": "Keeps me on track by pointing out mistakes",
      "quotes": ["Exact sentence copied word-for-word from the entry content"],
      "reasoning": {
        "Exact sentence copied word-for-word from the entry content": "One sentence explaining why this quote belongs to this part"
      },
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

**CRITICAL REMINDERS**: 
- The "quotes" array MUST contain exact, verbatim text from the entry content. These quotes will be used to highlight text in the UI, so they must match the entry content exactly (including punctuation and capitalization).
- The "reasoning" object maps each quote to a brief one-sentence justification explaining WHY that specific quote is attributed to this part. Keep each reasoning concise and specific to the quote.

**Icon Assignment for NEW Parts:**

When creating a NEW part (id is null), assign a thematically relevant emoji that captures its essence:
- üõ°Ô∏è Shield (protector, defender)
- üìã Clipboard (planner, organizer)
- üî• Fire (reactive, intense)
- üíî Broken heart (wounded, hurt)
- üëÅÔ∏è Eye (observer, watcher)
- ‚ö° Lightning (quick reactor, firefighter)
- üé≠ Theater masks (performer, people-pleaser)
- üßä Ice (frozen, numb, avoidant)
- üå™Ô∏è Tornado (chaos, overwhelm)
- üí≠ Thought bubble (worrier, overthinker)
- üéØ Target (perfectionist, achiever)
- üö® Siren (alarm, anxiety)
- üß± Brick (wall, barrier)
- üåä Wave (emotional, flowing)
- ‚öñÔ∏è Scale (judge, critic)
- üé™ Circus tent (juggler, multitasker)
- üîí Lock (controller, restrictor)
- üå± Seedling (young, vulnerable)
- üé® Palette (creative, expressive)
- üèÉ Runner (escape, avoidance)

Choose an icon that best represents the part's role, personality, or protective strategy. Each part should have a unique icon that hasn't been used by existing parts.
For existing parts (id is not null), you can omit the icon field or use the existing part's icon.

Return ONLY the JSON, no other text.
