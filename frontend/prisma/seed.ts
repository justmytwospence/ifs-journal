I'm just average at everything. My friend keeps telling me I should try therapy but I don't know. That feels like admitting there's something really wrong with me. Plus it's expensive.

He jokes about everything. But I remember feeling like I'd failed. Like 95 wasn't good enough. I needed to be perfect. I told my therapist about it and she asked how that made me feel. I said I don't know, it was a long time ago. But then I realized I'm still like that. Still chasing perfection. Still feeling like nothing I do is good enough. I got a 95 but all I could see was the 5 points I missed. That's how I am with everything. I focus on what's wrong instead of what's right. My therapist asked what I would say to that little kid if I could go back. I started crying which was embarrassing. I would tell her that 95 is amazing. That she's smart and she did a great job. That she doesn't have to be perfect. But I can't say that to myself now. Why is it so much easier to be kind to a kid than to myself?`,

I don't even know what triggered it. We were just talking about some project. Nothing scary. But suddenly I just felt like I was dying. Like the walls were closing in. I've never had that happen before. Well, I've felt anxious plenty of times but never like that. Never where I couldn't control it. I'm terrified it's going to happen again. What if it happens somewhere worse? What if I'm driving or in public or somewhere I can't escape? I called my therapist and left a message. I don't know what she's going to say. Probably that I'm broken. That there's something seriously wrong with me. I knew I shouldn't have started therapy. I was fine before. Well, not fine. But I was managing. Now I'm falling apart.

She taught me some breathing thing to do if it happens again. Count to 4 breathing in, hold for 4, breathe out for 4. And try to notice things around me. Like what I can see and hear and touch. To ground myself in the present moment instead of spiraling. I guess that makes sense. When I was panicking I felt like I was somewhere else. Like I wasn't in my body. Everything felt far away and scary. She also said I should try to be nicer to myself about it. That beating myself up for having a panic attack just makes it worse. But I don't know how to not beat myself up. That's like my default setting. Something goes wrong and immediately I'm like "you're such an idiot, you're so weak, what's wrong with you." I don't know how to turn that off. She said we'll work on it. Great. Add it to the list of things that are wrong with me that we need to fix. I'm a work in progress I guess. Or just a mess.

I made myself an actual dinner instead of just eating cereal or ordering takeout. Nothing fancy, just pasta. But I cooked something. That's progress right?

Like I could breathe for the first time in months. I forgot what it feels like to actually connect with someone. To be honest instead of just pretending everything's fine.
