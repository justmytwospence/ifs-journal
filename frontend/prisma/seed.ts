But she said it might help me process things between sessions so I guess I'll try it. I had my first therapy appointment today. I've been putting it off for months but my friend finally convinced me to go. She said it helped her a lot and that I should at least try it. I was really nervous walking in. Like what am I even supposed to say? Hi I'm a mess please fix me? But the therapist was nice. She didn't make me feel judged or anything. We just talked about why I decided to come in. I told her I've been feeling stuck lately. Like I'm going through the motions but not really living. Everything feels gray and flat. I wake up, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed, repeat. I'm not suicidal or anything dramatic like that. I'm just not happy. And I don't remember the last time I was actually happy. That's probably not normal right? She asked about my childhood and family which I wasn't expecting. I said it was fine. Normal. My parents are still married, I have a younger sister, we weren't rich but we weren't poor. Nothing traumatic happened. She said that's good but also that sometimes we can struggle even without big trauma. That made me feel a little better actually. Like I'm not being dramatic or making things up. She mentioned something called IFS therapy. Internal Family Systems. It sounds weird honestly. She said it's about different parts of ourselves. Like we're not just one person but we have different parts that have different feelings and wants. I don't really get it yet but she said we'll explore it more. I'm supposed to come back next week and also try journaling. So here I am. Writing to myself. Feeling awkward. But also maybe a tiny bit hopeful? Like maybe this could actually help. I don't know. We'll see.`,

Like when I want to do something but also don't want to do it at the same time. I told her about how I always cancel plans with friends. Part of me wants to go out and be social but then another part of me just wants to stay home. She got really interested in that. She asked me to describe the part that wants to stay home. What does it feel like? I said it feels tired and heavy. Like I just want to curl up and not deal with anything. She asked what it's trying to do for me. I guess it's trying to protect me from something? From being disappointed or rejected maybe? Or just from the effort of having to be "on" around people. Then she asked about the part that wants to go out. That one feels lighter but also kind of anxious. Like it knows I should be social and maintain friendships but it's worried I'm becoming a hermit. It's the part that feels guilty when I cancel. This is so weird to think about. Like I'm multiple people or something. But also it kind of makes sense? I do feel pulled in different directions a lot. She said that's totally normal and that all our parts are trying to help us in some way, even if it doesn't always feel helpful. She wants me to start noticing when I feel conflicted and try to identify what different parts might be present. Okay I can try that. It still feels strange but I'm trying to keep an open mind.`,

After the meeting I went to the bathroom and just stood there staring at myself in the mirror feeling like a failure. Then I got angry. At myself for not being better. At my boss for not appreciating what I do accomplish. At the whole situation. I came home and stress ate an entire bag of chips and half a pint of ice cream. Now I feel gross and guilty about that too. Great. I'm trying to think about this parts thing my therapist mentioned. There's definitely a part of me that feels really small and ashamed right now. Like I can't do anything right. But there's also this angry part that wants to tell everyone to fuck off. And then there's another part that's judging me for eating all that junk food. That one sounds like my mom honestly. Always commenting on what I eat and whether I'm taking care of myself. God I have so many voices in my head. Is this normal? Am I losing it? My therapist said this is normal but it doesn't feel normal. It feels exhausting. I just want to feel okay. Is that too much to ask?`,

But then I caught myself. Why do I do that? Why can't I just say thank you and accept the compliment? There's this part of me that doesn't want to seem arrogant or full of myself. It's safer to play small. If I don't claim any success then I can't fail right? But that's kind of sad. I mentioned this in therapy and my therapist seemed excited that I was noticing this pattern. She said that's a protective part trying to keep me safe from criticism or judgment. If I don't put myself out there, I can't be knocked down. But it also means I don't get to feel proud of myself or celebrate wins. She asked me what it would be like to just say thank you next time. To let myself feel good about doing something well. Honestly it feels scary. Like I'd be jinxing myself or something. But I want to try. I want to be able to feel good about my accomplishments without immediately minimizing them. Baby steps I guess.`,

Scrolling social media, watching TV, online shopping, whatever. I don't just sit with myself. And when I tried to just sit quietly for a few minutes, I got really uncomfortable. Anxious almost. Like I need to be doing something or I'm wasting time. But what am I running from? My therapist would probably say I'm avoiding something. Maybe I'm avoiding feeling my feelings. That sounds very therapy-speak but maybe it's true. If I'm always distracted, I don't have to think about the fact that I'm not happy with my life. I don't have to face the loneliness or the feeling of being stuck. I can just keep myself busy and numb and pretend everything is fine. Wow that got dark. But I think it's true. There's a part of me that just wants to keep the peace and not rock the boat. Don't think too hard about things. Don't ask difficult questions. Just keep going. But I'm tired of just keeping going. I want to actually live, not just exist. I don't know how to do that though. Hopefully therapy will help me figure it out.`,

Like maybe 10 or 12. She asked what that young part needed. And I just started crying. Which was embarrassing but she said it was okay. That young part just wants to be seen and valued for who I am, not for what I accomplish. It wants to be enough just as I am. We talked about how that part has been working so hard to try to earn love and approval. It thinks if I just achieve enough or impress people enough, then I'll finally be worthy. But it's exhausting and it never feels like enough. My therapist said that part is trying to protect me from rejection. If I can just be good enough, people won't leave me. But the truth is I'm already enough. I don't need to earn love. That's hard to believe though. Like intellectually I get it but I don't feel it. She said that's okay. It takes time. We're going to work on helping that young part feel safe and know that it's already worthy. I left therapy feeling raw and vulnerable but also somehow lighter. Like something shifted. I don't know.

And now I'm scared it's going to happen again. What if I can't control it? What if it happens somewhere worse? I texted my therapist and she said we can talk about it in our next session. She reminded me that panic attacks are scary but not dangerous. That my body is just trying to protect me from a perceived threat. Even if there's no actual threat. Great. So my body is broken. Awesome. I came home and just got into bed. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to see anyone. I just want to hide. There's this part of me that's so scared right now. Scared of having another panic attack. Scared of being broken. Scared of everything. And then there's the part that's angry at myself for being weak. For not being able to handle a simple meeting.

She said that sometimes when we start therapy and begin to process things, our protective parts can get scared. They've been working hard to keep us safe by keeping everything locked down. But when we start to open up and feel things, those parts panic because they think we're in danger. The panic attack was actually a part of me trying to protect me. It sounds backwards but it makes sense. That part thought something bad was going to happen in that meeting. Maybe it was afraid I'd say something wrong or be judged. So it created a crisis to get me out of there. It was trying to help, even though it didn't feel helpful. My therapist asked me to thank that part for trying to protect me. That felt weird but I did it. And then she asked me to let it know that I'm safe now. That I can handle the meeting. That I don't need such extreme protection. I don't know if it worked but I felt a little calmer after. She also taught me some grounding techniques for if it happens again. Focus on my senses. Name five things I can see, four things I can touch, three things I can hear, two things I can smell, one thing I can taste. It's supposed to bring me back to the present moment. I'm going to practice it. I don't want to have another panic attack but if I do, at least I have some tools now. I'm trying to be compassionate with myself. It's hard though.

I've been trying to notice the good things more. My therapist said I tend to focus on what's wrong and miss what's right. So I'm practicing. Today I noticed: the coffee I made this morning was really good. My coworker made me laugh. The sun felt warm on my face. I didn't have any meetings. Small things but they matter. I also didn't have any anxiety today. No panic. Just a normal, peaceful day. Those are rare for me lately so I want to appreciate it. I know there will be hard days again. But today was good. I'm learning that I have more control over my experience than I thought. I can choose what to focus on. I can choose to be kind to myself. I can choose to notice the good stuff.

I talked to my therapist about it and she helped me understand what's happening. There's a part that's afraid of being vulnerable with Sarah. Afraid she'll see how much I'm struggling and judge me or think I'm too much. It's easier to just avoid her than risk that. But there's also a part that's lonely and wants connection. That part knows I need friends and that isolating myself isn't helping. And then there's this other part that feels guilty for being a bad friend. For canceling plans and not reaching out. That part thinks I don't deserve friendship because I'm not good at maintaining it. So many parts, so many voices. My therapist asked me what I really want, underneath all of that. I want to see Sarah. I want to have a friend I can be real with. I want to stop hiding. So I'm going to say yes. Even though it's scary. Even though that protective part is freaking out.

That I'm sorry for being distant. I was terrified of how she'd react. But she was amazing. She said she'd noticed I seemed off and she was worried about me. She wasn't judging me at all. She actually opened up too. Told me she's been in therapy before and it really helped her. We talked for like three hours. Really talked. About real stuff. It felt so good to connect with someone like that. To be seen and accepted. That part of me that was so scared of being vulnerable feels a little less scared now. Like maybe it's safe to let people in. Maybe I don't have to do everything alone. Sarah hugged me when we said goodbye and told me she's proud of me for getting help. I cried a little.

Not perfect, but fine. I stumbled over a few words and my voice shook a little at the beginning. But I got through it. My boss said it was good work. A few people asked follow-up questions which means they were actually paying attention. I didn't die. I didn't have a panic attack. I just did the thing I was scared of and survived. I feel really proud of myself. That's new. Usually I'd focus on the parts that weren't perfect. The stumbles, the shaky voice. But I'm trying to celebrate the win instead. I did something hard and I did it well enough. That's worth acknowledging. My therapist is going to be so happy when I tell her. She's been encouraging me to challenge myself in small ways.

I let people walk all over me because I don't want to cause conflict. But my therapist says anger is just information. It's telling me that something isn't okay.

She asked me what I'm really angry about. I think I'm angry at myself for wasting so much time being miserable. For not getting help sooner. For letting fear run my life. I'm angry at my parents for not seeing that I was struggling as a kid. I'm angry at society for making me feel like I have to have it all figured out.

I was so proud. I ran to show my dad. And he looked at it and said "what happened to the other 5 points?" He was probably joking. He probably didn't mean anything by it. But I remember feeling like I'd disappointed him. Like 95 wasn't good enough. I needed to be perfect. After that I became obsessed with getting 100s on everything. I'd stay up late studying. I'd cry if I got anything wrong. I was so hard on myself. And I've been that way ever since. Never satisfied. Always pushing myself. Always feeling like I'm not enough. My therapist asked me what I wanted to say to that little kid. I started crying. I wanted to tell her that 95 is amazing. That she's smart and wonderful and she doesn't need to be perfect. That she's enough just as she is. It's easier to have compassion for that little girl than for myself now. But my therapist says they're the same person.

It thinks if it's hard on me, I'll work harder and be better. It's trying to protect me from failure and rejection. If I'm already criticizing myself, then other people's criticism won't hurt as much. It's trying to help, in its own harsh way. My therapist asked me if it's working. Is the criticism actually motivating me? Honestly, no. It just makes me feel like shit. It makes me want to give up. It makes me afraid to try new things because I might not be perfect at them. So it's not helping. It's hurting. My therapist asked me what I wanted to say to that part. I told it thank you for trying to protect me, but I don't need that kind of motivation anymore.

And what's the best case scenario? I go, I have a good time, I meet some new people, I feel proud of myself for trying. That would be amazing. And what's the most likely scenario? Probably somewhere in the middle. It's a little awkward but also kind of fun. I survive. I'm okay. When I think about it logically, the risk is worth it. But my anxious part doesn't do logic. It just feels the fear. My therapist suggested I go for just an hour. Give myself permission to leave if it's too much. That feels more manageable. I don't have to stay the whole time. I can just show up, try, and leave if I need to. I'm going to do it. I'm terrified but I'm going to do it.`,

And it was okay. Not amazing, not terrible. Just okay. I was definitely anxious at first. Didn't know where to stand or what to do with my hands. But Sarah introduced me to some people and they were nice. I had a few conversations. Nothing deep but pleasant. There was this one guy who was really into hiking and he talked about it for like 20 minutes. I just listened and asked questions. He seemed happy to have someone interested. I stayed for about two hours and then I left. I was exhausted from all the social interaction. But I did it. I pushed through the anxiety and I did it. And nothing bad happened. No one was mean to me. I wasn't the most interesting person there but I wasn't the most boring either. I was just a person at a party. Normal. The anxious part of me is surprised. It was so sure something bad would happen. But it didn't. Maybe it will start to trust me more. Trust that I can handle things. I'm proud of myself. This is progress. Real, tangible progress. I'm doing things I couldn't have done a few months ago. I'm facing my fears. I'm living my life instead of hiding from it. It feels good.`,

I still struggle with anxiety and that critical voice. But something has shifted. I understand myself better now. I understand that I'm not just one thing. I have these different parts, all trying to help me in their own ways. The part that wants to please everyone. The part that's scared of being hurt. The part that's angry. The part that's critical. The part that just wants to rest. They're all me. And they're all trying to protect me. I'm learning to listen to them instead of fighting them. To thank them for trying to help and gently redirect them when they're not actually helping. I'm learning that I don't have to be perfect. That I'm enough as I am. I'm learning to be vulnerable with people. To ask for help. To let people see me. I'm learning that feelings aren't dangerous. They're just information. I can feel them and survive. I'm learning to be compassionate with myself. To treat myself the way I'd treat a good friend. With kindness and understanding. I still have a long way to go. But I'm on the path. I'm doing the work. And I'm starting to believe that I can actually be happy. Not just okay, but genuinely happy. That feels like a miracle.`,

That people-pleasing part would kick in and I'd agree to anything to avoid disappointing anyone. But this time I paused. I checked in with myself. I'm already at capacity. Taking on more would stress me out and affect the quality of my work. So I said no. Well, I said "I don't have the bandwidth for that right now, but I could take it on next month." My boss was totally fine with it. She said okay and asked someone else. That's it. No drama. No anger. No rejection. I built it up in my head to be this huge scary thing and it was just a normal conversation. My therapist was so excited when I told her. She said that's a huge step. Setting boundaries is hard, especially for people pleasers. But it's necessary. I can't take care of everyone else at the expense of myself. I matter too. My needs matter. I'm still getting used to that idea. That it's okay to prioritize myself sometimes. That saying no doesn't make me selfish or mean. It just makes me human. I have limits and that's okay. Everyone has limits. I'm learning to respect mine.`,

I said I've been in therapy for a few months and it's really helping me. She was quiet for a moment and then she asked if it was because of something she did. I told her no, it's not about blame. It's just about me learning to understand myself better and work through some stuff. She asked what kind of stuff. I was honest. I told her about the anxiety, the perfectionism, the people-pleasing. How I've been struggling to feel good enough. She started crying. She said she had no idea I was going through all that. She said she's sorry if she ever made me feel like I wasn't enough. I told her it's not her fault. These patterns come from lots of places. But I appreciated her saying that. We talked for over an hour. Really talked. She told me about her own struggles with anxiety when she was younger. I never knew that. She said she's proud of me for getting help. That it takes courage. I felt so much lighter after we hung up. Like I'd been carrying this secret and now I don't have to anymore. My therapist was right. Vulnerability creates connection. When I let people see the real me, they can actually love the real me. Not just the perfect version I try to present.`,

Would have let that critical voice tear me apart. But I'm trying something different now. When I noticed myself starting to spiral, I stopped. I put my hand on my heart and I said to myself "You made a mistake. You're human. It's okay." It felt awkward at first. But I kept doing it. I acknowledged the part of me that was scared and ashamed. I told it I understand why it's upset. Making mistakes feels vulnerable. But one mistake doesn't define me. I'm still competent. I'm still worthy. I apologized to the person, corrected the error, and moved on. That's it. I didn't let it ruin my whole day. I didn't let it confirm all my worst beliefs about myself. I just treated it like what it was - a small mistake that happens to everyone. My therapist calls this self-compassion. Treating yourself with the same kindness you'd show a friend. It's hard. That critical part doesn't want to let go. It thinks if it stops being harsh, I'll become lazy or careless. But that's not true. I can hold myself accountable without being cruel. I can learn from mistakes without shame. This is new for me but I'm practicing. Every day I'm practicing being kinder to myself.`,

Like I don't deserve to be happy when I'm still working through so much stuff. When I still have bad days. When I'm still not perfect. Isn't that ridiculous? I can't even enjoy a moment of joy without that critical part jumping in to ruin it. I mentioned this in therapy and my therapist asked me where that belief comes from. That I don't deserve happiness. I don't know exactly. Maybe from growing up thinking I had to earn everything. That I had to be good enough to deserve good things. But that's not how it works. Happiness isn't something you earn. It's something you allow yourself to experience. Joy and struggle can coexist. I can be working on myself and still have moments of happiness. In fact, those moments are important. They remind me what I'm working towards. They give me hope. My therapist asked me to practice noticing joy without judgment. When something makes me happy, just let myself feel it. Don't analyze it or question whether I deserve it. Just feel it. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to let myself laugh. I'm going to let myself feel good. I'm going to let myself be happy, even if it's just for a moment. I deserve that. We all deserve that.`,

      content: `I'm starting to see how my different parts interact with each other. It's like they have relationships. When the anxious part gets activated, the critical part jumps in to try to control the situation. It thinks if it can just make me perfect, then there's nothing to be anxious about. But that just makes the anxious part more anxious because perfection is impossible. Then the part that wants to please everyone tries to smooth things over by making me say yes to everything and put everyone else first. But that exhausts me, so the part that just wants to rest and hide kicks in. And then the critical part judges me for resting, which activates the anxious part again. It's a cycle. A exhausting, painful cycle. But now that I can see it, I can interrupt it. When I notice the critical part getting loud, I can pause. I can thank it for trying to help and remind it that criticism isn't actually helping. When the anxious part gets activated, I can ground myself and remind it that I'm safe. When the people-pleasing part wants to say yes to everything, I can check in with myself about what I actually want and need. I'm learning to be the calm, compassionate presence in the middle of all these parts. My therapist calls it Self with a capital S. The part of me that's not reactive or scared or critical. The part that can hold space for all the other parts with love and understanding. I'm getting better at accessing that. It takes practice but I'm getting there.`,

I'm grateful for my friend Sarah. For sticking with me even when I was distant and flaky. For being understanding when I finally opened up. For inviting me to things even when I usually say no. She's a good friend and I don't tell her that enough. I'm grateful for my therapist. For creating a safe space where I can be messy and confused and not have it together. For helping me understand myself. For not giving up on me even when I wanted to give up on myself. I'm grateful for my body. I've been pretty mean to it over the years. Criticizing it, ignoring its needs, pushing it too hard. But it keeps showing up for me. It keeps breathing and moving and healing. It deserves better treatment. I'm grateful for this journaling practice. For giving me a place to process my thoughts and feelings. For helping me see my progress. For being a witness to my journey. I'm grateful for the hard days because they make me appreciate the good days more. I'm grateful for my parts, even the difficult ones. They're all trying to help me survive. I'm grateful for second chances. For the opportunity to change and grow. For not being stuck in old patterns forever. I'm grateful for hope. For believing that things can get better.

I want to wake up and not immediately start criticizing myself or worrying about everything. I want to feel comfortable in my own skin. I want to have meaningful relationships where I can be authentic. Where I don't have to perform or pretend. Where I can be messy and imperfect and still be loved. I want to do work that feels meaningful. I don't know what that looks like yet but I want to feel like I'm contributing something. Like my life matters. I want to be able to handle challenges without falling apart. To trust that I'm resilient and capable. To know that I can get through hard things. I want to enjoy my life. To notice beauty and joy. To laugh more. To be present instead of always worrying about the past or future. I want to be kind to myself. To treat myself with compassion and understanding. To be my own friend instead of my own worst enemy. I don't know if I'll ever be completely "healed" or whatever. Maybe that's not even the goal.

      content: `I had a really interesting realization in therapy today. All these parts I've been working with - the anxious one, the critical one, the people-pleaser, the one that wants to hide, the angry one - they're not separate from me. They ARE me. They're all aspects of who I am. And instead of trying to get rid of them or fix them, I'm learning to integrate them. To let them all have a voice without letting any one of them take over completely. It's like being the conductor of an orchestra. All the instruments are important. They all have something to contribute. But they need to work together in harmony. When one instrument is too loud, it drowns out the others. My critical part has been way too loud for way too long. It's been drowning out everything else. But I'm learning to turn down its volume. To let the other parts be heard too. The part that's creative and playful. The part that's wise and calm. The part that's brave and strong. They've been there all along. I just couldn't hear them over the criticism and anxiety. My therapist says this is what healing looks like in IFS. Not getting rid of parts but helping them find their right roles. Helping them trust that they don't have to work so hard to protect me. That I'm okay. That we're okay. I'm starting to feel more whole. More integrated. More like myself. Not the self I thought I should be, but the self I actually am. And that self is pretty okay.`,

Old me would have immediately compared myself to her and felt like a failure. That critical part would have jumped in with all the ways I'm not measuring up. But today I just felt happy for her. I even commented congratulations and meant it. There was no comparison. No judgment of myself. Just genuine happiness for someone else's success. That might not sound like a big deal but for me it's huge. I've spent so much of my life comparing myself to others and feeling like I'm losing some imaginary race. But there is no race. We're all on our own paths. Her success doesn't diminish me. My timeline doesn't have to look like anyone else's. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be right now. And where I am is okay. Better than okay actually. I'm doing the work. I'm growing. I'm healing. That's worth celebrating. I texted my therapist about this and she sent back a bunch of celebration emojis. She gets it. These small shifts in perspective are the real work. This is what progress looks like. Not dramatic transformations but small, steady changes in how I relate to myself and the world. I'll take it.`,

Now I'm still figuring things out but I have hope. I have tools. I have support. I have myself. And I'm learning that I'm enough. I'm looking forward to continuing to learn that.
